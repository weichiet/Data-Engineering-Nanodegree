# Project: Data Lake with Apache Spark

## Introduction

A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.  

The purpose of this project is to build an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.


## Project Datasets
The input datasets are reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

Song data: ```s3://udacity-dend/song_data```  
Log data: ```s3://udacity-dend/log_data```

The examples of the dataset can be found in the zip files under `./data` folder.

### Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json  
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

```json
 {"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
 ```

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, ```2018-11-12-events.json```, looks like:

## Schema for Song Play Analysis
A database schema was created for queries on song play analysis. The star schema includes the following tables (with ***italic bold*** fields as primary key):

### Fact Table
1. **songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong  
    * ***songplay_id***, *start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent, year, month*

### Dimension Tables
2. **users** - users in the app
    - ***user_id***, *first_name, last_name, gender, level*
3. **songs** - songs in music database  
  - ***song_id***, *title, artist_id, year, duration*  
4. **artists** - artists in music database  
  - ***artist_id***, *name, location, latitude, longitude*  
5. **time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
    - ***start_time***, *hour, day, week, month, year, weekday*

## Project Files
In addition to the data files, this project also includes other 3 files:  
1. ```etl.py```  reads data from S3, processes that data using Spark, and writes them back to S3
2. ```dl.cfg``` contains the AWS credentials
3. ```README.md``` provides the discussion on this project


## Project Steps
1. Launch an EMR Cluster on AWS.
2. Create a S3 bucket and fill in the link of the bucket in ```etl.py```.
3. Fill in the AWS credentials in ```dl.cfg```.
4. Execute ```etl.py``` and the tables will be save as parquets on S3.
