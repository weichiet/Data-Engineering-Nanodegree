# Project: Data Engineering Capstone

## Introduction

The purpose of the data engineering capstone project is to give you a chance to combine what you've learned throughout the program. You'll define the scope of the project and the data you'll be working with. You'll gather data from several different data sources; transform, combine, and summarize it; and create a clean database for others to analyze.

## Project Instructions
**Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data**
Since the scope of the project will be highly dependent on the data, these two things happen simultaneously. In this step, youâ€™ll:

* Identify and gather the data you'll be using for your project (at least two sources and more than 1 million rows). See Project Resources for ideas of what data you can use.
* Explain what end use cases you'd like to prepare the data for (e.g., analytics table, app back-end, source-of-truth database, etc.)

**Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data**
* Explore the data to identify data quality issues, like missing values, duplicate data, etc.
* Document steps necessary to clean the data.

**Step 3: Define the Data Model**
* Map out the conceptual data model and explain why you chose that model.
* List the steps necessary to pipeline the data into the chosen data model.

**Step 4: Run ETL to Model the Data**
* Create the data pipelines and the data model.
* Include a data dictionary.
* Run data quality checks to ensure the pipeline ran as expected.
  * Integrity constraints on the relational database (e.g., unique key, data type, etc.).
  * Unit tests for the scripts to ensure they are doing the right thing.
  * Source/count checks to ensure completeness.

**Step 5: Complete Project Write Up**
* What's the goal? What queries will you want to run? How would Spark or Airflow be incorporated? Why did you choose the model you chose?
* Clearly state the rationale for the choice of tools and technologies for the project.
* Document the steps of the process.
* Propose how often the data should be updated and why.
* Post your write-up and final data model in a GitHub repo.
* Include a description of how you would approach the problem differently under the following scenarios:
  * If the data was increased by 100x.
  * If the pipelines were run on a daily basis by 7am.
  * If the database needed to be accessed by 100+ people.

## Project Data
The data that I've chosen for this project is [I94 Immigration Data](https://travel.trade.gov/research/reports/i94/historical/2016.html).This data was originated from the US National Tourism and Trade Office. The data contains international visitor arrival statistics by world regions, and select countries. The data contains the type of visa, the mode of transportation, the age groups, states visited, and the top ports of entry for immigration into the United States.

The steps to complete this project are documented in [`Capstone_Project.ipynb`](./Capstone_Project.ipynb) notebook.
